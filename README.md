# Media System Client
--- 

Cusotom app for controling my [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv/) media system.

The app works by sending POST requests to the Kodi [JSON-RPC](https://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API/v10) API over my local network.

#### Currently Supports
- Basic video playback controls
- Arrow key interaction
- Text input

#### Potentional Enhancements
- Remote Spotify playback
- Wireless room light control

### Philosphy
The objective behind creating this app is to be rid of the proprietary operating system installed on my Roku TV. By using LibreELEC and controlling it through my custom built app on my phone, the media streaming process can be end-to-end open source.
